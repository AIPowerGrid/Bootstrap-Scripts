Scripts to automate AIPG wallet bootstrap

These scripts will easily allow you to bootstrap the AIPG Core wallet to avoid having to resync the entire blockchain.

Currently working on both Windows 10 and MacOS. Linux editions to be added

For the MacOS script, you will need to make the file executable by doing the following -

chmod +x BootstrapMacOS.sh

IMPORTANT - These scripts assume you have installed the wallet into the default locations. If you have not, you will need to edit the scripts to point towards your own AIPG data directory.
